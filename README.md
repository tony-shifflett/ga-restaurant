# Restaurant Mockup Challenge  
This website is built to conform to the Frontend Mockup challenge for General Assembly's Tech Assessment Power Week.

## Live Deployment
I've deployed live at [netlify](restaurant-ga.netlify.app)

### Mockup
This website is a build out of the mockup found [here](https://github.com/dcartist/FrontEndHackathon/blob/master/MOCKUP/README.MD#restaurant-mockup)

### MVP 
MVP for this project is a functional replication of the prompt mockups, without restriction on the use of frameworks and freedom to choose font and supply icons and images as needed to build out the page. 

MVP calls for a desktop version of the site only. 

### Post MVP 
Post MVP goals are deployment and a mobile friendly version of the website. 

## Tools
I created the website using create-react-app. 

## Assets 
Assets were provided as part of the challenge and can be found in the original repos.
